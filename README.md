# Technical Art Test

## Light the sprite

For this assignment, you will be provided with the following:

* A scene with sprite artwork, orbitted by 2 colored light sources.
* A folder of images (`Assets/lighting/`), depicting light for the artwork from the top, bottom, left and right direction.

Make the artwork look like it's being lit up by the light sources. You can use the provided assets as-is or create derivative assets as you see fit.

Your solution will be evaluated on visuals and technical merit.
